        "A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.\n\nGames are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.\n\nHowever, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games)"

    "longDescription": "Gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight'), or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light are attracted to (or gravitate toward) one another.\n\nOn Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides.\n\nThe gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing and forming stars and caused the stars to group together into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe.\n\nGravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get further away"

    "longDescription": "World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945.\n\nIt involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers.\n\nIn a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources."

    "creator": "Miss. Archana",
    "longDescription": "Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof.\n\nWhen mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature.\n\nThrough the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects.\n\nPractical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist."
